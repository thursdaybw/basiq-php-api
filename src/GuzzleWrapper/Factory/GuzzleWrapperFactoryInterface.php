 * interface designed for our needs, and some custom wiring, for example
 * enabling Guzzle's logging.
 *
 * We have two GuzzleWrapperFactories, one is build with a basic
 * auth header in the HTTP client, the other with a bearer token in the
 * header.
 *
 * This interface allows us to instantiate the GuzzleWrappers as service
 * via these factories.
