This namespace holds an API, an interface for communication with the
remote BasiqAPI service.

Todo:

  - Work has been made towards separating this API from front end code
    - The front end needs to create it's own adaptor to fully disconnect us here.
  - Prove we can swap guzzle out, create a CURL http client and swap it out.
