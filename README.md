### Introduction
The Basiq PHP API is a library designed to simplify interaction with the Basiq REST API. It provides a common and simple interface for retrieving banking data, building budget apps, tracking spending, and more. The library takes care of token management, is configurable, and offers a simplified HTTP client interface.

### Features
- **Token Management**: Automatic tracking and refreshing of the application bearer token.
- **Simplified HTTP Client**: Custom wrappers for Guzzle, providing simplified GET, POST, and request methods.
- **Authentication**: Supports both basic authentication (for token retrieval) and bearer token authentication.
- **Logging and Debugging**: Configurable logging using Monolog, with plans to separate it into a configurable service.
- **Exception Handling**: Custom exception class for handling Guzzle exceptions.
- **Dependency Injection**: Utilizes PHP-DI for managing services and dependencies.

### Components
- **API Interface**: Main interface for interacting with the Basiq API.
- **Bearer Token Manager**: Manages JWT tokens, including creation, refresh, and storage.
- **Guzzle Wrappers**: Custom wrappers for Guzzle, including factories for basic auth and bearer token auth.
- **HTTP Client Interface**: Defines a contract for HTTP clients, allowing for different implementations (e.g., CurlWrapper).

### Security Considerations
- Retrieves data from the sandbox using HTTPS.
- API keys are kept out of the repository and must be injected, usually via environment variables.

### Use Case Implementation
- Provides a common interface for integrating other PHP applications to retrieve banking data.
- Wraps Guzzle, simplifying the HTTP client interface and allowing for swapping out the lower-level HTTP client.
- Demonstrated implementation in a Symfony project, with potential for Drupal module integration.

### Future Considerations
- **Testing**: PHPUnit and static code analysis are planned for future development.
- **Hardening**: Open to customization and enhancements as the tool is further developed.

### Dependencies
- PHP >= 8.1
- PHP-DI ^7.0
- Monolog ^3.4
- GuzzleHttp ^7.7

### Conclusion
The Basiq PHP API is a robust and flexible library for integrating with the Basiq API. With features like automatic token management, simplified HTTP client interaction, and configurable logging, it provides a solid foundation for building financial applications.
